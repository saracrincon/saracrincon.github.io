<p>This is an enclosed, ventilated laboratory workspace for safely working with materials contaminated with pathogen requiring a defined biosafety level.</p>

<p>When used correctly, a curtain of room air enters the grill at the front edge of the BSC work surface and acts as a protective barrier. Do not use the top of the cabinet for storage; this can damage the HEPA filter. Keep only necessary equipment or supplies inside.</p>
