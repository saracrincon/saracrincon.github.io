<p>This is a device that uses steam to sterilize equipment and other objects. That means that all bacteria, viruses, fungi, and spores are inactivated.</p>

<p>Make sure the door of the autoclave is fully closed and the correct cycle has been selected before starting. Wear heat resistant gloves when cracking the autoclave door open after a run. Before removing items, wait 5 minutes for loads containing only dry glassware, and 10 minutes for autoclaved liquid.</p>
