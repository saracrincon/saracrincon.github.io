<p>This tool is used to transport measured volume of liquid. This tool works by creating a vacuum above the liquid-holding chamber and selectively releasing this vacuum to draw up and dispense liquid.</p>

<p>Do not put the pipettes in your mouth, do not allow the solution to be drawn up into the bulb, do not insert the pipet into the hole in the bulb.</p>
