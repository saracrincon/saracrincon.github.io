<p>This instrument is uses focused light and lenses to magnify a specimen, usually a cell. Light microscopes send light through a path that first focuses the light into a tight beam and then passes that light through a sample, which creates an image. That image then passes through one or more lenses to magnify it until it reaches the userâ€™s eye or a camera.</p>

<p>You must know the instrument! Always carry the microscope with both hands. One hand should support the bottom, and the other should have a firm grip on the arm. Since most slides are covered with chemicals or biological substances, extra care is recommended. Users should always wear proper clothing and protective gear as needed. Be sure to clean and disinfect the eyepiece!</p>
