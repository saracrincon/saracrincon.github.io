<p>This is a simple tool used mainly in microbiology to retrieve an inoculum from a culture of microorganisms. The loop is used in the cultivation of microbes on plates by transferring inoculum for streaking.</p>

<p>When using this instrument one should tie back long hair, since the burner will be on. Wear lab coat and gloves. Carefully place the loop in the flame until it turns orange, let it cool and obtain inoculum, streak inoculum, place loop in the flame again to ensure any leftover organism are eliminated (sterilize loop).</p>
